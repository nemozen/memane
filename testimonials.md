<b>Testimonial</b>

My wife and I lived for a year in an apartment in MeMaNe. We really enjoyed our stay there and found the apartment comfortable, spacious, and well appointed. The landlord was really helpful and accommodating in meeting our requests. There was a small problem with the sealing around some of the windows in the rainy season, but this was rapidly dealt with as soon as we reported the problem. The rooftop terrace with the view over Addis is a real bonus and we enjoyed many an evening up there watching the sunsets.

The staff were unfailingly helpful and cooperative, maintaining the building and the security for the property, as well as always being on call if there were any little issues to be dealt with.

All in all, we can recommend MeMaNe with comfortable and spacious apartments, with easy access to the International School, the supermarkets at Bisrate Gabriel, and the Laphto Mall shopping centre. The neighbourhood was safe and we had no problems in that regard. Easy access to the Golf Club for those so inclined.
